The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. Machine learning itself employs different models to make prediction easier and authentic. The paper focuses on the use of Regression and LSTM based Machine learning to predict stock values.
